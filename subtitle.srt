00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,804
*Naruto screaming in shock*

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Kakashi: Calm down Naruto...

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,310
Naruto: Be quiet, as far as I'm concerned
he's enemy number one.

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,250
You were the most important thing in the world
to him, and he meant nothing to you?

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,920
Naruto: He threw his life away... and for
what?

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,759
Naruto: A broken tool.

7
00:00:16,759 --> 00:00:18,510
Man that's so wrong.

8
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,350
Zabuza: You talk too much.

9
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:25,590
Your words cut deep, deeper than any blade.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,917
Zabuza: Boy, give me your kunai.

11
00:00:28,917 --> 00:00:33,028
*Gato getting destroyed by Zabuza*

12
00:00:33,028 --> 00:00:35,028
*Gato taking a dip in the pool*
