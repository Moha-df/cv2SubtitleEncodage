00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,500
You're a jerk, Thom.

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Look Celia, we have to follow our passions;

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,500
...you have your robotics, and I
just want to be awesome in space.

4
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,000
Why don't you just admit that
you're freaked out by my robot hand?

5
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not freaked out by- it's...

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
...alright! Fine!

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm freaked out! I have nightmares
that I'm being chased...

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
...by these giant robotic claws of death...

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Whatever, Thom. We're done.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,500
Robot's memory synced and locked!

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
This is pretty freaky.

12
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Shouldn't you be down there?

13
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I heard you guys talking last night.

14
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's not my fault, you know.
